# jenkinsapp
This is a native Jenkins CI IOS app written in the Swift2 language - containing an universal iPhone/iPad app with Apple Watch support. It can only be compiled with the Xcode 7 beta - and it is not yet in the App Store. 

Why this app? There is only one app for Jenkins and itâ€™s not native. Also I wanted to learn swift and native iOS development so the code is not very clean at the moment.

For now it is only a experiment and not very stable, but the goal is to build a fancy app that can trigger builds from your Apple Watch.

If your are a swift developer or you want learn, please send me message and contribute!
